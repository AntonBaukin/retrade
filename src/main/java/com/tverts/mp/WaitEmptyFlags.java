 * during the waiting. At the moment when all of them
 * are complete, all waiting threads are released.
 *
 * This implementation handles the case when the same
 * flag is set more than one time. If some procedure
 * sets a flag, it must release it lately.
 *
 * It is also possible to release flag before occupying
 * it what can reduce additional synchronizations.
 * If some flag is released before occupation, the
 * latter would not cause the following wait request
 * to block (on this flag).
 *
 * As the result: a flag is removed from the set when
 * it's occupy/release counter equals to zero. When
 * all the flags are removed, the waiting threads are
 * resumed.
