 *
 * Genesis unit has an optional condition that defines
 * whether the instance may be actually invoked.
 *
 * Genesis unit may be a stateful object. It is allowed
 * to store invocation-dependent state in it.
 *
 * To bypass the possible concurrent problems the
 * prototype instance is cloned. Note that condition
 * check and the generation are on the same instance.
