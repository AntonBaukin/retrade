 * Represents an analogue of Servlet Filter.

 * a Servlet Filter must invoke the chain of
 * filters to continue filtering, thus creating
 * a stack of filters call, this filter may
 * either return immediately, or continue
 * the filters chain recursively.
 *
 * A Filter must be thread-safe (reentable).

	 * (also, indirectly) {@link FilterTask#continueCycle()} to
	 * continue the cycle. Transaction scopes are created in this way.
